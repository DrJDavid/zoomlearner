# Phase 1.2: State Management Setup Checklist

## Overview
This phase focuses on creating the React Context-based state management layer that will bridge our services with the React components. We'll implement the ReaderContext and ReaderProvider while ensuring they work seamlessly with our existing services.

## Prerequisites
- [x] Phase 1.1 completed successfully
- [x] ReaderService implementation verified
- [x] AuthService implementation verified
- [x] No modifications to existing vanilla JS code

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Directory Setup
- [x] Create `src/store` directory
- [x] Add `.gitkeep` to ensure directory is tracked

### 2. Context Implementation
- [x] Create `src/store/ReaderContext.tsx`
- [x] Add necessary imports:
  ```typescript
  import React, { createContext, useState, useRef, useEffect, ReactNode }
  import { ReaderService } from '../services/ReaderService'
  import { AuthService } from '../services/AuthService'
  import { User } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
  ```
- [x] Implement ReaderContext:
  - [x] Define ReaderContextType interface
  - [x] Create context with createContext
  - [x] Add proper TypeScript types

### 3. Provider Implementation
- [x] Create ReaderProvider component:
  - [x] Initialize state variables:
    - [x] isPlaying
    - [x] speed
    - [x] currentWord
    - [x] text
    - [x] fontSize
    - [x] isDarkMode
    - [x] currentWordIndex
  - [x] Set up service refs:
    - [x] readerServiceRef
    - [x] authServiceRef
  - [x] Implement useEffect for service initialization
  - [x] Add event subscriptions:
    - [x] play/pause events
    - [x] speed change events
    - [x] text change events
    - [x] progress change events
  - [x] Implement context value object
  - [x] Add state update functions:
    - [x] toggleDarkMode
    - [x] setFontSize
    - [x] loadTextContent
    - [x] playReader
    - [x] pauseReader
    - [x] setReaderSpeed

### 4. Export Setup
- [x] Create `src/store/index.ts`
- [x] Add exports for:
  - [x] ReaderContext
  - [x] ReaderProvider
  - [x] ReaderContextType interface

### 5. Type Safety
- [x] Verify all TypeScript types are properly defined
- [x] Ensure no 'any' types are used
- [x] Add proper return types to all functions
- [x] Validate null checking for service refs

### 6. Testing Setup
- [x] Create `src/store/__tests__` directory
- [x] Create `ReaderContext.test.tsx`:
  - [x] Test context creation
  - [x] Test provider initialization
  - [x] Test state updates
  - [x] Test service integration
  - [x] Test event handling

### 7. Safety Checks
- [x] Verify no runtime errors on context initialization
- [x] Ensure proper cleanup in useEffect
- [x] Validate event subscription/unsubscription
- [x] Check localStorage integration for preferences
- [x] Verify service method forwarding

## Verification
- [x] TypeScript compilation succeeds
- [ ] All tests pass
- [x] No console errors
- [x] Context can be instantiated
- [x] Provider wraps components without errors
- [x] State updates work as expected
- [x] Service integration functions properly

## Notes
- DO NOT modify existing vanilla JS implementation
- Keep all new code isolated in the store directory
- Document any assumptions or decisions made
- Note any technical debt or future improvements needed

## Next Steps
- [ ] Document completion of this phase
- [ ] Update migration plan with any learnings
- [ ] Prepare for Phase 1.3: Service Integration

## Technical Notes
1. The ReaderContext implementation follows React's Context API best practices
2. Service instances are maintained using useRef to prevent recreation on re-renders
3. Event subscriptions are properly cleaned up in useEffect's cleanup function
4. Dark mode preference persists across sessions using localStorage
5. All state updates are handled through the context to maintain a single source of truth
6. TypeScript types ensure type safety throughout the implementation
7. Comprehensive test suite covers:
   - Context creation and initialization
   - Service integration and method forwarding
   - State management and updates
   - Event subscription lifecycle
   - Dark mode persistence
   - Reader control operations
